# 🚀 **Denoising Autoencoder**

---

📌 **Overview**
This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Denoising Autoencoder**, covering its architecture, theory, and real-world applications. Learn how to remove noise from images using deep learning with step-by-step code and explanations!

📖 **What is a Denoising Autoencoder?**
A **Denoising Autoencoder** is a type of neural network designed to reconstruct clean data from noisy inputs. It consists of two main components:

🔹 **Encoder:** Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
🔹 **Decoder:** Reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.

Autoencoders are widely used for:
✅ Image Denoising  
✅ Feature Extraction  
✅ Anomaly Detection  
✅ Data Compression
